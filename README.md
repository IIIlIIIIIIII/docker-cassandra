# Docker Compose 
You can use docker compose to deploy Cassandra as a single node or as a cluster.
To deploy a single node issue

    docker-compose up -d

To deploy a Cassandra cluster with two nodes use the `docker-compose-cluster.yml` file. To add more nodes edit the `docker-compose-cluster.yml` file, add a new node and configure the environment variables accordingly. 
To deploy the cluster issue

    docker-compose -f docker-compose-cluster.yml up -d
